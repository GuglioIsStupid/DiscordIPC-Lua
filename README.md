# DiscordIPC-Lua

DiscordIPC-Lua is a lua library for interacting with the Discord IPC (Inter-Process Communication) API. This library has no external dependencies.

This library is only for use with LuaJIT with FFI enabled. It will not work with the standard Lua interpreter due to the use of FFI.

Check [main.lua](main.lua) for an example of how to use this library.

This library can work for Love2D, or any other LuaJIT environment.
